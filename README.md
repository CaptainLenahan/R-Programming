# Flu Data

This project was about the flu in the USA. With the flu becoming especially prominent this year, our group was interested
in the ways flu has spread, mutated, and affected our population. Our project contains many visuals that look at both
the state and national level for influenza in the USA, sourced from data provided by the CDC.
